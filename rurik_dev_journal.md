### ✅ What I Set Up Today
- Created Rurik's project folder and virtual environment
- Installed Flask and tested the Flask server
- Set up three terminal tabs: 🧠 Rurik Server, 📨 Test Sender, 💻 Code Editor
- Learned how to identify the right tab using process IDs
- Sent test `curl` emails successfully

### 🔄 Next Steps
- Start backing up code with Git
- Integrate Gmail and Google Calendar access
- Begin teaching Rurik what counts as an “important” email
